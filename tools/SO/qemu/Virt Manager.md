# Virtual manager Archilinux


QEMU Management on Arch Linux

To manage QEMU/KVM on Arch Linux, you’ll need to install the following packages:

    libvirt: a virtualization management library
    qemu: the QEMU emulator
    virt-manager: a graphical user interface for managing virtual machines


Install the packages using the following command:

```
sudo pacman -S libvirt qemu virt-manager ebtables dnsmasq bridge-utils
```
 

Enabling KVM

Check if the KVM kernel module is loaded:

```
sudo modprobe kvm_intel
```
 

If it’s not loaded, you can enable it permanently by creating a configuration file:
```
echo "options kvm-intel nested=1" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/kvm-intel.conf
```
 

Configuring PolicyKit

To allow non-root users to manage virtual machines, create or edit the file /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-org.libvirt.unix.manage.rules:
```
sudo nano /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-org.libvirt.unix.manage.rules
```
 

Add the following lines:
```
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
  if (action.id == "org.libvirt.unix.manage" && subject.user == "your_user") {
    return polkit.Result.YES;
  }
});
```

Replace your_user with your actual username.
Starting and Enabling Services

 Start the libvirtd service:

```
sudo systemctl start libvirtd
```
 

Enable the service to start automatically on boot:
```
sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
```
 

Launching Virt-Manager

    Search for virt-manager in your application menu or run it from the terminal:
```
virt-manager
```
 

    Create a new virtual machine or manage existing ones using the graphical interface.

Additional Tips

    Make sure your system architecture is supported by KVM (x86_64 or i686).
    If you encounter issues with nested virtualization, check your BIOS settings and ensure that hardware acceleration is enabled.
    For ARM-based systems, QEMU can be installed, but KVM support might be limited or require additional configuration.

By following these steps, you should be able to install and configure QEMU/KVM on Arch Linux, allowing you to manage virtual machines using the virt-manager GUI.
